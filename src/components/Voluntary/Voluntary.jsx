               During my student life I worked as a teacher for more than two years in Vivekananda School which provides volunteer service to poor children. 
               I am member of Vivekananda Sikkha o Sanskriti Porisad, Jagannath Hall, University of Dhaka which provides different kinds of volunteer services to the society. I  provide donation to this organization regularly. I am ex-member of Management Students Association of  Jagannath Hall, Dhaka University.
